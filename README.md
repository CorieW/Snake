# Snake
Just a terminal based Snake game.

Features:
- Colours
- Pause Menu
- Tap To Begin

Maybe in Future:
- Statistics such as: Best score, total food collected, total games played, average score

What I Learnt:
- Printing coloured text in the terminal window.
- Setting the terminal window size.
- Recieving the key the user is pressing in the terminal window.
- The concept and code flow idea of creating a Snake game.
